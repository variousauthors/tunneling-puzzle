RULES     
======     

( NOTES )
( something should happen if the player makes a loop )
( I was thinking everything inside the loop is obliterated )
( and replaced with traversable voidscape )
( and a shocking sound effect plays )
( but it should be impossible to make a loop for the first little while )

( should the flow that passes through walls appear over the walls? )

( add virtual blocks that follow the concrete blocks )
( add a virtual robot that follows the concrete robot )
( when the player tries to disengage the console in a way )
( that would create an illegal position for the robot )
( cancel that shit )
( while in the console, the robot is not a pusher )

( on every turn after the first )
( we want the turn to cancel if the player did not move )
( this is because the player controls decorators like the Engineer )
( which do not interact with blocks on their own )

[Player no FirstTurn no ConsoleCenter] -> [Player Shadow]
[FirstTurn] -> []
late [Player Shadow] -> cancel
late [Shadow] -> []

( the player pilotes the engineer )
[> Player Engineer] -> [> Player > Engineer]

( the player pilotes the arms )
horizontal [> Player Robot][HorizontalArm][VirtualHArm] -> [> Player Robot][> HorizontalArm][> VirtualHArm]
horizontal [> Player ConsoleCenter][HorizontalArm][VirtualHArm] -> [Player ConsoleCenter][> HorizontalArm][> VirtualHArm]
vertical [> Player Robot][VerticalArm][VirtualVArm] -> [> Player Robot][> VerticalArm][> VirtualVArm]
vertical [> Player ConsoleCenter][VerticalArm][VirtualVArm] -> [Player ConsoleCenter][> VerticalArm][> VirtualVArm]

( the arms control the robot and the virtual robot )
[> Arm][Robot][VRobot] -> [> Arm][> Robot][> VRobot]

( the engineer can activate and deactivate the robot )
[action Player Engineer Controls] [Robot] -> [Engineer Controls] [Player Robot]
[action Player Robot] [Engineer] -> [Robot] [Player Engineer]

( or the virtual consol )
[action Player Engineer VirtualControls] [ConsoleCenter] -> [Engineer VirtualControls] [Player ConsoleCenter]
[action Player ConsoleCenter] [Engineer] -> [ConsoleCenter] [Player Engineer]

( pushers push pushable things )
[ > Pusher | Pushable ] -> [  >  Pusher | > Pushable  ]

( clear the overlays )
[ Overlays ] -> []
[ overload ] -> []

( render overlays )

( adjacent sources transfer power )
late right [ Source | Source ] -> [ Source RS | Source LS ]
late down [ Source | Source ] -> [ Source DS | Source US ]

( power transfers through walls )
late right [ Source | Wall | Source ] -> [ Source RS | Wall RS LS | Source LS ]
late down [ Source | Wall | Source ] -> [ Source DS | Wall DS US | Source US ]

( overloads )
late [ RS LS DS ] -> [ RS LS DS overload ]
late [ RS LS US ] -> [ RS LS US overload ]
late [ US DS LS ] -> [ US DS LS overload ]
late [ US DS RS ] -> [ US DS RS overload ]

( render Z )

[ SourceZ ] -> []
[ USZ ] -> []
[ WallZ ] -> []

late up [ Source | no SourceZ ] -> [ Source | SourceZ ]
late up [ Source US | SourceZ ] -> [ Source US | SourceZ USZ ]

late up [ Wall | no WallZ ] -> [ Wall | WallZ ]
late up [ Wall US | WallZ ] -> [ Wall US | WallZ USZ ]
